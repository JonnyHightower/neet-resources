# This file is a list of issues noticed, before even the GSMs run.
# The file is split into two sections: the first part lists the issues themselves
# If the first field isn't NEETSDMISSUE, then neet assumes it's the name of a real service. If the first field
# IS NEETSDISSUE, then neet assumes it's an issue definition.

# The fields are Asterisk separated, and are set out as follows:
# NEETSDMISSUE*IssueReference*LogAs [issue/vuln/comp]*ISSUE TEXT

# ISSUE TEXT can have replacement data dynamically inserted into it; the following markup is supported:
# %PROTO%  - this will be replaced with the protocol on which the service was found
# %PORT% - this will be replaced with the port number on which the service was found
# %HOST% - this will be replaced with the host IP address on which the service was found
# %SERVICE% - this will be replaced with the name of the service

NEETSDMISSUE*SDM1*issue*The SSH server on host %HOST% port %PROTO%/%PORT% supports SSH protocol 1.
NEETSDMISSUE*SDM2*issue*The SSH server on host %HOST% port %PROTO%/%PORT% supports only SSH protocol 1.
NEETSDMISSUE*SDM3*issue*Host %HOST% is running a clear-text service (%SERVICE%) on port %PROTO%/%PORT%.
NEETSDMISSUE*SDM4*issue*Host %HOST% potentially vulnerable to user enumeration on port %PROTO%/%PORT% (%SERVICE%).
NEETSDMISSUE*SDM5*issue*Host %HOST% is running a seldom-used service (%SERVICE%) on port %PROTO%/%PORT%.
NEETSDMISSUE*SDM6*issue*Host %HOST% is running the r-services %SERVICE% service on port %PROTO%/%PORT%.
NEETSDMISSUE*SDM7*vuln*Host %HOST% is running the REXEC service on port %PROTO%/%PORT%. This is usually open to unauthenticated remote command execution.
NEETSDMISSUE*SDM8*vuln*Host %HOST% is running a default Oracle 9i installation %PROTO%/%PORT%. This is vulnerable to a number of problems.

# Haven't thought of what happens if a particular port is subject to more than one issue, such as Rusersd - 4 and 6

# The next section of the file contains the services and banners that trigger the issues being written to the file.
# Service (Neet translated name)*Vulnerable Banner String(If Applicable)*IssueReference (Corresponding to those above)
